The final deliverable consists of an Android app and a website for the Manager viewpoint of the mentioned tutoring app. It should allow the manager to manage tutors and students, book rooms for lessons, add courses, subjects and universities.

All functionality of the system is to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders.
